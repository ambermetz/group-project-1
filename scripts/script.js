// ○ The item(s) the user will buy will be added to a cart until they are ready
// for checkout.

// class checkout items
// -items need to go into an empty Array.
//     - add method - event listener (outside of the method) that will add the item to a cart page.
// - Creates a div on the cart page and users innerHTML to display items
// - Items price need to be displayed by adding them all together in the array:
// - delete button  - that removes the div from the page
//                              - update the total
// - display method for the total to show in a div at the top of the page.

// ● Provide a way for the user to check out and view their cart.
// Completed:
// created buttons already

// Need to do:

// ● Give the subtotal, sales tax, and the total.
// Subtotal = will have this as a method in the checkout class
// Create a method to take the items and show a subtotal, sales tax, and total

// ● If the user is paying in cash, ask for the amount tendered and provide change.
// take the total from the cash checkout page and display remaining.

// ● If the user is paying with a card, ask for the card number, expiration, and CVV.
// Done

// ● Provide a receipt for the payment which includes the item(s) bought, the
// subtotal, total, and anything else of interest.

// Create a modal when Submit button is pushed
// create a modal function that adds in the other functions and displays them.

// ● A stretch goal is to implement validation for credit card numbers...
// Might be an HTML thing that we can look into.
